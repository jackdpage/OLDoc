Included Fixtures
=================

Pylux comes with some fixture templates which you can used to quickly add 
fixtures to your plot without having to repeat values that don't vary from 
one fixture to another. When supplying a template to the ``xn`` command, 
give the Pylux Short Name for the fixture.
