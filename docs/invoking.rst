Invoking
========

When you install Pylux, it will automatically add the ``pylux`` executable to 
your PATH, meaning that Pylux can be executed in any directory simply by 
running ``pylux`` in a shell. There are, however, some additional arguments 
you can pass to Pylux when you run it.

-h, --help  Print the usage message then exit.
-v, --version  Print the version number then exit.
-g, --gui  Launch in GUI mode.
-f FILE, --file FILE  Load FILE as the project file
-V  Set output verbosity. 
        Omit for WARNING, include once for INFO, include twice for DEBUG.
