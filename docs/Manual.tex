\section{Introduction}
Pylux is a program written in Python for the manipulation of OpenLighting Plot
documents. Pylux currently allows for the basic editing of the OpenLighting
Plot XML files, including referencing OpenLighting Fixture files to obtain
additional data.

In the future, Pylux will be extended with modules that allow for the exporting
of documentation in the \LaTeX{} format, and creating lighting plots in SVG 
format.

Bugs and feature requests should be submitted to 
\url{https://github.com/jackdpage/pylux/issues}.

\section{Command-line Options}
Pylux is invoked simply by running the \texttt{plotter.py} program. Windows 
operating systems should automatically associate file with the Python 
interpreter. The program contains a shebang line for compatibility with UNIX
systems. 

\paragraph{\texttt{--help}, \texttt{-h}}
Display the usage message of the program then exit.

\paragraph{\texttt{--version}, \texttt{-v}}
Display the version number of the program then exit.

\paragraph{\texttt{--file \textit{FILE}}, \texttt{-f \textit{FILE}}} 
Load the file with path \textit{FILE} as the project file on launch.

\section{Basic Concepts}
Pylux uses the OpenLighting Plot format as its document format. This format 
specifies three main components of an XML document: the meta section, the 
fixtures section and the registries section. In its current version, Pylux 
can only read and write to the latter two sections.

The fixtures section contains multiple fixture elements, each of which has 
various data associated with it, depending on the fields as defined by the 
fixture's OpenLighting ID (olid).

The registries section contains one or more DMX registries, each of which 
contains some channel elements, which contain both the UUID of the fixture 
they control and their function.

\section{Fundamental Commands}
When launching Pylux, you are presented with an interactive prompt. This 
prompt accepts many commands, all of which are one or two characters long and 
may take one or more arguments. A complete list of commands is included below: 

\subsection{Utility Commands}

\paragraph{\texttt{h}}
Display a list of the available commands for the interactive prompt. This 
prints the contents of \texttt{help.txt}  to the output.

\paragraph{\texttt{c}}
Clears the screen of previous input and output. This uses the system screen 
clearing command. (\texttt{clear} on UNIX, \texttt{cls} on Windows)

\paragraph{\texttt{q}}
Exit the program. This is a clean exit, without asking for any confirmation or 
checking for unsaved buffers.

\subsection{File Commands}

\paragraph{\texttt{fl \textit{FILE}}}
Load the file with path \textit{FILE} as the project file. This will override 
any unsaved buffer associated with the previous project file, if there was one.

\paragraph{\texttt{fs}}
Save the current file buffer to its original location.

\paragraph{\texttt{fS \textit{PATH}}}
Save the current file buffer to a new file with location \textit{PATH}.

\subsection{Fixture Commands}

\paragraph{\texttt{xa}}
Add a new fixture. This will initiate an interactive sequence, starting by 
entering the olid of the new fixture. The program will then ask the user to 
specify the value of the variables as specified by the associated 
OpenLighting Fixture file. It will also ask the user to specify a DMX universe 
to put the channels that this fixture requires in. The user can either 
specify a start address or allow the program to choose the most appropriate 
start address by typing \texttt{auto}.

\paragraph{\texttt{xl}}
List all the fixtures in the plot. This will generate a list of every fixture 
in the plot, listing an interface reference, the fixture olid, and the fixture 
UUID.

\paragraph{\texttt{xf \textit{TAG VALUE}}}
List all the fixtures in the plot which have a tag called \textit{TAG} with a 
value of \textit{VALUE}. Like the list function, this will list an interface 
reference, the fixture olid and UUID, and also the value of the tag that was 
given for verification purposes.

\paragraph{\texttt{xi \textit{REF}}}
List all the information associated with the fixture with interface reference 
\textit{REF}. \textit{REF} is the number given to a fixture by either the 
list or filter commmand. It must be the number given by the most recently run 
command, as this interface reference buffer is updated each time one of these 
commands is run.

\paragraph{\texttt{xr \textit{REF}}}
Remove the fixture with the interface reference \textit{REF}. This fixture 
will be removed from the plot, but associated DMX channels will not be 
removed, use the upcoming command \texttt{xp} for that.

\subsection{DMX Registry Commands}

\paragraph{\texttt{rl \textit{UNIVERSE}}}
List all the used channels in \textit{UNIVERSE}. This will list the DMX 
address, fixture UUID and function of every channel in the DMX registry with 
identifier \textit{UNIVERSE}.
