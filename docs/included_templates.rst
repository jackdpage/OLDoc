Included Templates
==================

Pylux comes with a few Jinja templates for use with the ``reporter`` context. 
Jinja templates can be in any format and can be used to make extremely 
powerful output when written in HTML and combined with JavaScript 
interactivity. When specifying a template, you should not write the file 
extension. If there are multiple templates with the same name, Pylux will 
list them for you and let you choose.
