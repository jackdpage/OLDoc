Introduction
============

This section of the documentation is aimed at developers who wish to 
contribute to the Pylux project with code. If you want to contribute in 
another way, see the Content Creator section.

This section documents the API provided by Pylux to allow for quick addition 
of new features, and also potentially third-party extension support in the 
future.

The majority of the API is found within the plot module, there are however 
some other modules provided which you may find to be useful.
