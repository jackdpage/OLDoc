Importing Data
==============

You can import data from an Eos ASCII export::

  File ImportAscii export.asc

This imports the Eos patch from the export.asc file. There are no other
options. This will import all the information in ``export.asc`` including
fixtures, patch, cues, groups and palettes. If there are any conflicts
between the existing show file and the import, the existing show file will
be preserved.
