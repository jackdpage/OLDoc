Contributing
============

Pull requests and issues from anyone are always welcome, provided they meet the guidelines below. By submitting a pull 
request, you agree that your contributions will be made freely available under the terms of the license in ``COPYING`` (the 
GNU GPLv3).

Preparation
-----------
Fork the repository and clone locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Pylux.git
```
Install Pylux from the Git clone on your system:
```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
Make your changes and re-run the installation to ensure it works as expected.


Code Contributions
------------------
If you are making a code contribution, first make sure that the change you are making is either resolving an issue on the GitHub
issue tracker, or is resolving an item from ``TODO.txt``. If you wish to make a change that does not appear in either, create 
a new issue.

Make sure that your changes are being made in the correct module or context. Your code should comply with the 
[Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Any changes you 
make which are not bug fixes must be documented using the Google docstring format. If you wish to document your changes in the 
docs themselves, submit this as a separate pull request.

Content Contributions
---------------------
Content contributions (such as fixtures, symbols and templates) should be submitted via a pull request too. You may make a 
content pull request for anything, even if it is not in ``TODO.txt`` or on the issue tracker.
